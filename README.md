# 😷 Face Mask Detection App

An AI-powered web application that detects whether a person in an uploaded image is wearing a face mask or not. Built using **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit**, this project utilizes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network to perform real-time classification of masked and unmasked faces.

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Upload image and detect faces
- ✅ Predict mask status using a trained deep learning model
- 🎯 Accurate and fast classification
- 🧠 CNN-based model with OpenCV face detection
- 🌐 Lightweight web app using Streamlit

---

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Face Detection:** OpenCV SSD face detector  
  (`res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel`)
- **Mask Classifier:** Custom-trained CNN using Keras
- **Frameworks Used:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, Streamlit, NumPy

## 🖥️ Demo

Upload an image with one or more faces. The app will highlight each detected face and label it as:

- 🟢 **Mask**
- 🔴 **No Mask**
